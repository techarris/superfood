Superfood
==================

"Superfood" is a term often used in marketing to describe foods that are 
nutrient-dense and believed to have various health benefits. While there is no
strict scientific definition for what constitutes a superfood, they are typically
characterized by their richness in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and/or other
beneficial compounds. 

People often incorporate superfoods into their diets to maintain good health,
boost energy levels, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
