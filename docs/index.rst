beneficial compounds. 

People often incorporate superfoods into their diets to maintain good health,
boost energy levels, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Balanced Diet and Skepticism

While incorporating superfoods can contribute to maintaining good health, relying solely

to approach any health claims related to superfoods with skepticism. Such claims are often
used for marketing purposes, and the actual health benefits can vary depending on several 
factors, including how these foods are prepared and consumed.

Defining Criteria for Superfoods
